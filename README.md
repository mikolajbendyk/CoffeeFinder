# CoffeeFinder

Coffee is the most popular beverage in the world. However, is it easy to find? Well, yes, it is, but…

**CoffeeFinder** is an app to find coffee. But not any coffee. Its purpose is to find special coffee – sometimes specialty coffee actually.

In Poland, where I come from, there are more than a hundred coffee roasteries functioning – some say, that maybe even up to three hundred! Every one of those roasteries roast fresh coffee every day. **CoffeeFinder** is here to help you find your favourite. 

The application which you can see here is a final project at Java Developer bootcamp at CodersLab. It is not a functioning app yet, it is more of a prototype of an app that I hope to set up one day.

I would appreciate any feedback both about the code and project structure, and the idea itself.


Let’s see what this is about.

#### Direct trade
Small roasteries have a completely different business model than huge companies producing coffee. They are often in a personal relation with farmers, who grow and pick the coffee with their own hands (literally, coffee is picked by hand). Thanks to long-term and direct relations farmers get better fees for their coffee and gain stability.

#### Quality
Coffee on this market of small businesses is high quality. It is grown at high altitudes, picked by hand, selected by hand and processed with care and attention.

#### Roasteries
Green beans are transported to roasteries. Roasteries are local businesses, there is a big chance that in your town is at least one. Buying from them you can support local economy.

#### Roasting
Coffee available in stores is always roasted dark, so the roast covers any unpleasant flavours the coffee has. Therefore, the coffee is very bitter and hard to drink as it is e.g., without milk. But real joy from drinking coffee is not about mixing awful liquid with something that makes it bearable to swallow.
Two things are needed. We already have good quality coffee. Now the important thing is not to break it. That’s why roasting is so important. There is a wide spectrum of how you can roast coffee. Qualified roasters can choose adequate roast to concrete coffee and to concrete brewing methods. In effect you get delicious coffee which is not bitter but sweet in a way and which give you a real pleasure from drinking it.

#### Freshness
Now, even if the coffee is good quality and it is perfectly roasted, it still can get spoiled. After roasting coffee very quickly loses its flavours and aromas. Generally, it is best to use coffee until one month after roasting. Of course, after that time coffee still has flavour, but if you want to get from your cup the most – don’t let it age.

#### Why CoffeeFinder?
Coffee market in Poland is pretty developed. There are popular internet stores, like CoffeeDesk, where you can buy coffee from polish roasteries. But – firstly – those shops offer only some coffee from some roasteries. And secondly, the coffee is being stored by the shop, so it is not as fresh, as it could – and should – be.
What can you do then? You can buy directly from a roastery. Most of them have a webpage with an online shop, where you can order all of their coffees. They don’t store big volumes of roasted coffee, but roast it often, so usually the coffee is only few days old. Sounds great.
Most roasteries have about twenty different coffees in offer. So, what if you visited few webpages and you couldn’t find the coffee you are looking for? Maybe the prices were too high, maybe there wasn’t coffee from your favourite country, maybe you just didn’t like the webpage itself.

That is where **CoffeeFinder** would come in. It would gather offers from all roasteries’ stores in one place. It would allow you to search for coffee visiting only one webpage. You could sort the offers, you could filter them selecting the country of origin, brewing method or other various features. And if you’d like some coffee, you’d just click on it and the hyperlink would get you to the roastery’s shop, where you could buy it.
